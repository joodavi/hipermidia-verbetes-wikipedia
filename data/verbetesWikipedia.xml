		<title>10G EPON</title>
		<text>The term 10G EPON refers to 10 Gbit s Ethernet Passive Optical Network standard IEEE 802 3av ref http www ieee802 org 3 av IEEE P802 3av Task Force ref The standard supports two configurations symmetric operating at 10 Gbit s data rate in both upstream and downstream directions and asymmetric operating at 10 Gbit s in the downstream direction and 1 Gbit s in the upstream direction Standardization Timeline In March 2006 IEEE 802 3 working group held call for interest CFI for 10 Gbit s EPON study group According to the CFI materials representatives from the following companies

formed the 802 3av task force to produce the draft standard for 10 Gbit s EPON In September 2009 the IEEE 802 Plenary ratified the amendment to 802 3 to make 802 3av a standard The following are the major milestones in 10 Gbit s EPON study group class wikitable border 1 Date Milestone September 2006 IEEE 802 3av task force is formed First task force meeting in Knoxville TN December 2007 Draft D1 0 is produced July 2008 Draft D2 0 is produced Working Group balloting begins November 2008 Cut off date for last technical change January 2009 Draft D3 0 is produced Sponsor balloting begins September 2009 Standard approval Architecture Symmetric 10 Gb s EPON 10 10G EPON Symmetric rate 10 10G EPON supports transmit and receive data paths operating at 10 Gbit s The main driver for 10 10G EPON is the necessity to provide adequate downstream and upstream bandwidth to support the Multi Dwelling Unit MDU environment When deployed in the Multi Dwelling Unit MDU configuration one EPON ONU may be connected to up to a thousand subscribers The 10 10G EPON employs a number of functions that are common to other point to point Ethernet standards For example such functions as 64B 66B line coding self synchronizing scrambler or gearbox are also used in 10GBASE SR 10GBASE LR 10GBASE ER 10GBASE LRM and 10GBASE KR types of Ethernet links Asymmetric 10 Gb s EPON 10 1G EPON The asymmetric 10 1G EPON appear less challenging than the symmetric option as this specification relies on fairly mature technologies The upstream transmission is identical to that of the existing 1G EPON as specified in IEEE Std 802 3ah and will rely on field proven and mass deployed burst mode optical transceivers The downstream transmission which uses continuous mode optics will rely on the maturity of 10 Gbit s point to point Ethernet devices Power budgets The 802 3av defines several power budgets denoted either PR or PRX PRX power budget describes asymmetric rate PHY for PON operating at 10 Gbit s downstream and 1 Gbit s upstream PR power budget describes symmetric rate PHY for PON operating at 10 Gbit s downstream and 10 Gbit s upstream Each power budget is further identified with a numeric representation of its class where value of 10 represents low power budget value of 20 represents medium power budget and value of 30 represents high power budget The 802 3av draft standard defines the following power budgets class wikitable border 1 Power Budget Downstream Line Rate Gb s Upstream Line Rate Gb s Channel Insertion Loss dB Notes PRX10 10 3125 1 25 20 compatible with PX10 power budget defined for 1G EPON PRX20 10 3125 1 25 24 compatible with PX20 power budget defined for 1G EPON PRX30 10 3125 1 25 29 PR10 10 3125 10 3125 20 compatible with PX10 power budget defined for 1G EPON PR20 10 3125 10 3125 24 compatible with PX20 power budget defined for 1G EPON PR30 10 3125 10 3125 29 Forward error correction The 10G EPON employs a stream based forward error correction FEC mechanism based on Reed Solomon 255 223 The FEC is mandatory for all channels operating at 10 Gbit s rate i e both downstream and upstream channels in symmetric 10 Gbit s EPON and the downstream channel in the 10 1 Gbit s asymmetric EPON Upstream channel in the asymmetric EPON is the same as in 1 Gbit s EPON i e optional frame based FEC using RS 255 239 Backward compatibility The 10G EPON standard defines a new physical layer keeping the MAC MAC Control and all the layers above unchanged to the greatest extent possible This means that users of 10G EPON can expect backward compatibility of network management system NMS PON layer operations administrations and maintenance OAM system DBA and scheduling and so on Coexistence with 1G EPON The 802 3av standard places significant emphasis on enabling simultaneous operation of 1 Gbit s and 10 Gbit s EPON systems on the same outside plant In the downstream direction the 1 Gbit s and 10 Gbit s channels are separated in the wavelength domain with 1 Gbit s transmission limited to 1480 1500 nm band and 10 Gbit s transmission using 1575 1580 nm band In the upstream direction the 1 Gbit s and 10 Gbit s bands overlap 1 Gbit s band spreads from 1260 to convert 1360 nmi km abbr on 10 Gbit s band uses 1260 to convert 1280 nmi km abbr on band This allows both upstream channels to share spectrum region characterized by low chromatic disperson but requires the 1 Gbit s and 10 Gbit s channels to be separated in time domain Since burst transmissions from different ONUs now may have different line rates this method is termed dual rate TDMA Various OLT implementations may support 1 Gbit s and 10 Gbit s transmissions only downstream direction only upstream direction or in both downstream and upstream directions The following table illustrates which ONU types are simultaneously supported by various OLT implementations class wikitable border 1 OLT Implementation Supported ONU types Downstream two wavelengths BR Upstream single rate 1 1G EPON ONU BR 2 10 1G EPON ONU Downstream single wavelength BR Upstream dual rate 1 10 10G EPON ONU BR 2 10 1G EPON ONU Downstream two wavelengths BR Upstream dual rate 1 1G EPON ONU BR 2 10 1G EPON ONU BR 3

		<title>2 XL</title>
		<text>for the Estonian band formerly known as 2XL Soul Militia 2 XL was an educational toy in the shape of a robot that was introduced in 1978 2 XL was the brainchild of Dr Michael J Freeman who felt that toys should be both fun and educational The toy was interactive playing various tracks from a magnetic audio tape depending on the user s actions The toy was released in two different time periods The 1978 release was produced by a toy company called Mego Corporation and used Stereo 8 8 track tapes It was brought back in 1992 by Tiger Electronics in a version that used Compact audio cassette cassette tapes rather than 8 Track Mego Corporation version Description Image 2 XL jpg thumb right 250px Mego Corporation s 2 XL circa 1978 The original 2 XL see image to right was made of hard brown plastic with white plastic on the front The toy had two yellow light bulbs for eyes that flashed at various moments while the 8 track program tapes played and he had four red push buttons on his stomach Question A or Yes Or True B or More Info C or No or False There was also a volume and power on knob found on the lower right portion of the unit At the bottom was a large slot where an 8 Track tape would be inserted The toy was essentially a regular 8 Track player with each button operating a different track It was powered by a common 9 volt AC adapter with a 3 5 mm mini plug tip Development Michael J Freeman had a hard time convincing companies of the benefits that his toy would provide Many companies turned down the idea saying it was just too expensive and not practical to invest so much into an educational toy when kids are typically reluctant to buy educational items Finally Mego Corporation decided that it fit in well with their company They were makers of action figures based on popular TV shows many of which were sci fi related Freeman was involved with all phases of the toy s development including how the internal mechanism worked The Mego version of 2 XL was produced for four years 1978 1981 The mold and look got a minor change in 1980 The eye lights became red The louder the volume was turned the brighter the lights would flash The speaker in the back of the unit was changed from a hexagon shape to a more traditional round speaker shape The plastic was shiner and glossier looking All told there were about 50 program tapes made for the Mego 2 XL It was highly popular in its first years but it faded into obscurity after the turn of the decade The toy will often show up on auction sites and in used toy stores They aren t rare by any means but aren t in mass quantities either Some of the tapes can be harder to find the last year tapes are rarer due to the decreased popularity of the toy in its last year on the market Programs The 8 Track tapes focused around a robot with a New York accent voiced by creator Dr Michael J Freeman Ph D himself who would speak as if the listener was right there with him wherever he happened to be in the storyline He would ask multiple choice questions based on the subject of the tape and the user would answer the question he asked by pushing the corresponding button A right answer resulted in 2 XL congratulating the user on his knowledge while a wrong answer would result in a razzing as 2 XL explained what the proper answer was In between questions there would sometimes be a story going on that the user was involved with with the answers to the questions corresponding to the storyline Other times 2 XL would crack a bad joke and laugh at his own humor with a crazy sounding laugh that was one of the many running gags that would be found on almost every tape in the series Originally the programs were very basic There was just one general story line Each track flowed through the same time length differing only by telling the user if he was right or wrong Eventually Dr Freeman started to take advantage of the four tracks found on a tape to have up to three different programs on one tape There were some general themes to each tape The first was 2 XL s bleeping and buzzing sound effects as it turned on as if the user was activating a huge robot although he would often refer to its size as only a foot or so tall He would always introduce himself in the same way saying Thank you for turning me on I am 2 XL The voice did not sound robotic and was pretty much Michael s voice only a bit slower speaking and more sophisticated sounding There would always be a moment where the user had to push the Question button as that went back to track one which is where the main talking took place There was always music or beeping sounds while the user would think or while the new questions were loading to make the program space out properly Towards the end of the tape 2 XL would give the user a warning that he was getting tired and that it was time to wrap things up with one last question He was always very friendly and acted very human as if he was a new buddy that wanted to help the user learn in the most enjoyable way possible His humor was silly as were his wisecracks but the same themes were found throughout the various tapes getting more and more creative as the future tapes were introduced He would often say Please turn me off now and often relate the reason he had to go somehow to the topic of the tape Deleted image removed Image 2 XLtapes JPG thumb right 250px Eight of Mego Corporation s 2 XL 8 Track Tapes 2 XL came with one tape titled General Information which touched on various topics such as sports movies and pop culture Each of the various other program tapes was sold separately and most came with a separate activity book that could be used as well while doing the activity with 2 XL Some also came with faceplate cards that could be placed over the various buttons that had different words on them that were specifically to be used for that certain program tape Not all of the tapes were educational some told stories that the user would just listen to able to answer a few questions about them afterwards Not all tapes were focused around 2 XL either Other voices would appear on them depending on what the focus of each tape was But somewhere 2 XL s voice would show up to keep everything in the same universe There were also two tape sets that would continue on with the theme of the first tape after the user finished it Tiger Electronics version Image 2 xltiger JPG thumb right 250px Tiger Electronic s version of 2 XL along with some program cassette tapes circa 1992 In 1992 Tiger Electronics re introduced 2 XL Instead of 8 track tapes the new version used cassette tapes that were twice the length of the 8 tracks and had better sound quality Freeman again provided the toy s voice In addition to eyes that would light up the toy now sported a circle for a mouth that could light up as he talked The toy could now run on batteries and had a headphone jack Instead of the buttons simply switching tracks on the 8 track tape as in the old version the cassette version took advantage of the fact that a cassette has a total of four tracks one for the left and right channel on each side The tape head in the player could play any of the four parallel tracks based on which button was pressed Playing a 2 XL tape in a standard tape player would result in different audio on the left and right channels and if the reverse side was played which was typically marked with the words Wrong Side one would hear the other two tracks played in reverse As with the previous version the cassette version could play any standard cassette tape but the user needed to first push the Question button or the 2 A No button would work as well playing the right channel Pressing the 3 or 4 button would play one of the channels on the reverse side of the tape backwards Image 2 XLx men casette jpg thumb right 125px Tiger Electronic s X Men Cassette Adventure tape for the 2 XL toy Newly released tapes were branded with comic book and cartoon characters including Spider Man Star Trek The Next Generation Mighty Morphin Power Rangers X Men and Batman 2 XL games would allow the user to go on an adventure with various superheroes deciding their fate by pushing one of the buttons The second version was on the market from 1992 through 1994 and about 45 tapes were released in total The final inventory was sold in 1995 bundled with the Power Rangers tape It was one of the most popular toys in terms or market revenue sold up through 1995 This version of 2 XL got even more exposure due to it being used on a kids TV Game Show at the time named Pick Your Brain A 10 foot replica of the Tiger Electronics 2 XL was used on the set to ask questions and offer extra information on the topic being talked about Freeman was asked to do the voice of 2 XL but declined The show was hosted by Marc Summers and 2 XL on this show was voiced by Greg Berg This show had a high success in its first year but was ended when the production of 2 XL ceased Tri Lex One of the last tapes released for the Mego Corporation version of 2XL was Tri Lex a complete board game designed to be played by 2XL The tape came with a board which fitted over the front of the 2XL unit itself with the board in front of the tape slot The game board consisted of an inverted pyramid shape 4 squares wide at the top to 1 square at the bottom with each row coloured in a different colour Blue Yellow Green and Tan and 4 slots through which pieces which 2XL called checkers could be dropped into the pyramid The slots aligned with 2XL s 4 buttons with the intention that dropping the checker would also press the appropriate track button on 2XL The objective of the game was to create either a line or a triangle of 3 checkers of your own colour The game and tape design are interesting because they enabled the 4 track tape player to provide a passable simulation of a game playing AI Several tricks had to be used an additional set of front slots that did not interact with the buttons were provided and 2XL occasionally told the player to make a move in the front so that the track would not change 2XL would also ask the player to remember a codeword at certain points in the game and to repeat it back later Often the game would end before the tape did meaning that 2XL would prompt the player with please turn my volume down to zero after which the player would have to wait for the remainder of the current game s recording to wind through before a track changing click signalled they should turn the volume back up For this reason Tri lex was the only 2XL tape that did not say thank you for turning me on at the start since the player was expected to play several games in a single session Finally although the tape appears to loop after one game it in fact has four games recorded on it The game itself is easily solved and correctly played always ends in a win for the starting player The tape was thus more valuable for teaching pattern recognition than as a genuine board game On the tape the player can in fact beat 2XL but only on two of the recorded games those where the human player goes first The player can defeat 2XL by using the guaranteed win or on occasion by using other strategies where 2XL makes a mistake 2XL does not use the guaranteed win strategy against human players The guaranteed win is as follows first player plays Tan forced only space available second player plays Green 1 2 forced only spaces available which one does not matter as the ensuing positions are mirror images of each other continue following the moves on the appropriate side of the first player plays Green 2 1 second player plays Yellow 3 1 forced else first player plays it and wins with a line first player plays Yellow 2 second player plays Blue 3 or 4 1 or 2 first player plays Blue 4 or 3 2 or 1 forced else second player plays it and wins with a triangle second player plays Yellow 1 3 forced only space available first player plays Blue 2 3 and wins with a line of three Similar Toys Kasey the Kinderbot Kasey the Kinderbot was a toy designed by Dr Freeman which was targeted at kids aged 3 7 Instead of tapes as with the previous versions this toy used small cartridges that were not linear the user was able to jump around to various sections at will It was purely an educational toy with cartridges focusing on such subjects as Math Science and languages The cartridges were also color coded to let kids know what group of subject it belonged to The toy was first released in 2002 by Fisher Price It produced a total profit of over 70 million Spin off characters included Toby the Totbot which focused specifically on teaching letters and numbers and Fetch the Phonicsbot which was a dog shaped robot holding a letter board which was aimed at the toddler age group See also Talk n Play a children s cassette player that also used the four audio tracks for interactivity with cassette book sets External links http www 2xlrobot com World of 2

		<title>26 bit</title>
		<text>N bit 26 In the ARM Limited ARM ARM_architecture processor architecture 26 bit refers to the design used in the original ARM processors where the Program Counter PC and Status_register Processor Status Register PSR were combined into one 32 bit Processor_registers register R15 the status flags filling the high 6 bits and the Program Counter taking up the lower 26 bits In fact because the program counter is always word aligned the lowest two bits are always zero which allowed the designers to reuse these two bits to hold the processor s mode bits too The four modes allowed were USR26 SVC26 IRQ26 FIQ26 contrast this with the 32 possible modes available when the program status was separated from the program counter in more recent ARM Architecture ARM architectures This design enabled more efficient Computer_program program execution as the Program Counter and status flags could be saved and restored with a single operation This resulted in faster subroutine calls and interrupt response than traditional designs which would have to do two register loads or saves when calling or returning from a subroutine History Despite being 32 bit internally processors prior to the ARM6 had only a 26 bit PC and address bus and were consequently limited to 64 MB of addressable Random_Access_Memory memory This was still a vast amount of memory at the time but because of this limitation architectures since have included various steps away from the original 26 bit design The ARM6 introduced a 32 bit PC and separate PSR as well as a 32 bit address bus allowing 4 GB of memory to be addressed The change in the PC PSR layout caused incompatibility with code written for previous architectures so the processor also included a 26 bit compatibility mode which used the old PC PSR combination The processor could still address 4 GB in this mode but could not Execution_ computers execute anything above address 3FFFFFC 64 MB This mode was used by RISC OS running on the Risc_PC Acorn Risc PC to utilise the new processors while retaining compatibility with existing software More recent ARM architectures such as Intel s XScale have dropped the 26 bit mode altogether External links http web archive org web 20070809230809 http www arm com pdfs Apps11vC html Differences Between ARM6 and Earlier ARM Processors http www iyonix com 32bit download 32bit_dev pdf Using the Acorn C C Development Environment to write 32 bit RISC OS software Details on the architectural changes and converting code between 26 bit and 32 bit http www heyrick co uk assembler 32bit html Information on converting assembler to 32 bit Category ARM architecture</text>

BSD first released in 1992 It ran on PC compatible computer systems based on the Intel 80386 microprocessor 386BSD innovations include role based security ring buffer s self ordered configuration and Loadable kernel module modular kernel design History 386BSD was written mainly by Berkeley alumni Lynne Jolitz and William Jolitz William Jolitz had considerable experience with prior BSD releases while at the University of California at Berkeley 2 8 and 2 9BSD and both contributed code to Berkeley developed at Symmetric Computer Systems during the 1980s Work on porting 4 3BSD Reno and later 4 3BSD Net 2 to the Intel 80386 was done for the University of California by William Jolitz at Berkeley 4 3BSD Net 2 was an incomplete non operational release with portions withheld by the University of California as encumbered i e subject to an AT T UNIX source code license The 386BSD releases made to the public beginning in 1992 were based on portions of the 4 3BSD Net 2 release coupled with additional code see Missing Pieces I and II Dr Dobb s Journal May June 1992 written by William and Lynne Jolitz to make a complete operational release The port began in 1989 and the first incomplete traces of the port can be found in 4 3BSD Net 2 of 1991 It was first released in March 1992 version 0 0 and in a much more usable version on July 14 1992 version 0 1 The porting process with code was extensively documented in an 18 part series written by Lynne Jolitz and William Jolitz in Dr Dobbs Journal beginning in January 1991 FreeBSD and NetBSD After the release of 386BSD 0 1 a group of users began collecting bug fixes and enhancements releasing them as an unofficial patch computing patchkit Due to differences of opinion between the Jolitzes and the patchkit maintainers over the future direction and release schedule of 386BSD the maintainers of the patchkit founded the FreeBSD project in 1993 to continue their work ref http www freebsd org doc en_US ISO8859 1 books handbook history html About the FreeBSD Project Bot generated title ref Around the same time the NetBSD project was founded by a different group of 386BSD users with the aim of unifying 386BSD with other strands of BSD development into one multi platform system Both projects continue to this day Lawsuit Due to a lawsuit Unix System Laboratories USL v Regents of the University of California some potentially so called encumbered source was agreed to have been distributed within the Berkeley Software Distribution from the University of California and a subsequent release 1993 4 4BSD Lite was made by the University to correct this issue However 386BSD Dr Dobbs Journal and William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz were never parties to these or subsequent lawsuits or settlements arising from this dispute with the University of California and continued to publish and work on the 386BSD code base before during and after these lawsuits without limitation There has never been any legal filings or claims from the University USL or other responsible parties with respect to 386BSD Finally no code developed for 386BSD done by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz was at issue in any of these lawsuits Release 1 0 In late 1994 a finished version 386BSD Release 1 0 was distributed by Dr Dobb s Journal on CDROM only due to the immense size 600 megabyte MB of the release the 386BSD Reference CD ROM and was a best selling CDROM for three years 1994 1997 386BSD Release 1 0 contained a completely new kernel design and implementation and began the process to incorporate recommendations made by earlier Berkeley designers that had never been attempted in BSD Relationship with BSD 386 386BSD is often confused with BSD 386 which was developed by Berkeley Software Design BSDi a Berkeley spinout starting in 1991 BSD 386 used the same 386BSD code contributed to the University of California on 4 3BSD NET 2 Although Jolitz worked briefly for UUNET which later spun out BSDi in 1991 the work he did for them diverged from that contributed to the University of California and did not appear in 386BSD Instead William Jolitz gave regular code updates to Donn Seeley of BSDi for packaging and testing and returned all materials when William Jolitz left that company following fundamental disagreements on company direction and goals Copyright and use of the code All rights with respect to 386BSD and JOLIX are now held exclusively by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz 386BSD public releases ended in 1997 since code is now available from the many 386BSD derived operating system s today along with several derivatives thereof such as Apple Computer Apple s Darwin operating system Darwin and OpenBSD Portions of 386BSD may be found in other open systems such as OpenSolaris 386BSD is available for

		<title>3D Pose Estimation</title>
		<text>merge Pose computer vision Pose Estimation discuss Talk 3D Pose Estimation Merger proposal date March 2010 3D pose estimation is the problem of determining the transformation of an object in a 2D image which gives the 3D object The need for 3D pose estimation arises from the limitations of feature based pose estimation There exist environments where it is difficult to extract corners or edges from an image To circumvent these issues the object is dealt with as a whole through the use of free form contours ref cite web author Bodo Rosenhahn url http www ks informatik uni kiel de modules php name Publikationen title Pose Estimation of 3D Free form Contours in Conformal Geometry publisher Institut fur Informatik und Praktische Mathematik Christian Albrechts Universitat zu Kiel language English German accessdate 2008 06 09 ref 3D Pose Estimation from an Uncalibrated 2D Camera It is possible to estimate the 3D rotation and translation of a 3D object from a single 2D photo if an approximate 3D model of the object is known and the corresponding points in the 2D image are known A common technique for solving this has recently When been POSIT where the 3D pose is estimated directly from the 3D model points and the 2D image points and corrects the errors iteratively until a good estimate is found from a single image ref cite web author Dementhon and Davis 1995 url http

gif The goal is to find the pose Rotation R and Translation t which gives the 3D object in its object coordinate system gallery Extracting 3D from 2D Starting with a 2D image image points are extracted which correspond to corners in an image The projection rays from the image points are reconstructed from the 2D points so that the 3D points which must be incident with the reconstructed rays can be determined Pseudocode The algorithm for determining pose estimation is based on the Iterative Closest Point algorithm The main idea is to determine the correspondences between 2D image features and points on the 3D model curve code a Reconstruct projection rays from the image points br b Estimate the nearest point of each projection ray to a point on the 3D contour br c Estimate the pose of the contour with the use of this correspondence set br d goto b br code The above algorithm does not account for images containing an object that is partially occluded The following algorithm assumes that all contours are rigidly coupled meaning the pose of one contour defines the pose of another contour code a Reconstruct projection rays from the image points br b For each projection ray R br c For each 3D contour br c1 Estimate the nearest point P1 of ray R to a point on the contour br c2 if n 1 chose P1 as actual P for the point line correspondence br c3 else compare P1 with P br if dist P1 R is smaller than dist P R br then choose P1 as new P br d Use P R as correspondence set br e Estimate pose with this correspondence set br f Transform contours goto b br code In practice using a 2 GHz Intel Pentium processor average speeds of 29fps have been reached using the above algorithm ref name Bodo Rosenhahn Estimating Pose Through Comparison Systems exist which use a database of an object at different rotations and translations to compare an input image against to estimate pose These systems accuracy is limited to situations which are represented in their database of
